              The PICT MUN Club, established in 2016, consists of a group of
              inquisitive students who are passionate about social, political
              and economic issues that elude the future of our World. PICT MUN
              strongly believes in the important role of dialogue and discussion
              in solving any problem and hence always abides by its motto
              'Think.Discuss.Prosper.' PICT MUN organizes an annual MUN
              conference and various public speaking events to engage the youth,
              who are the torchbearers of the future, in stimulating
              conversations. This encourages them to discuss and debate on
              important issues and find a common ground to agree on, thus
              promoting a sense of individuality as well as collectivism and
              helps them understand the universal principle of tolerance.
