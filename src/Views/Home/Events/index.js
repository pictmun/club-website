              Apart from the annual MUN conference, PICT MUN was the first club
              at PICT to organize various intra-college public speaking events
              to motivate people to express their views in front of a diverse
              audience. With an exchange of ideas taking place, it not only
              widens one's mindset but also helps them develop tolerance towards
              a difference in opinions. We believe in giving each individual the
              opportunity to develop their public speaking skills.
