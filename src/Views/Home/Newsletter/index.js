              'The Inquisitor' is a monthly newsletter published by our in-house
              team of amazing writers, graphic designers and researchers at the
              PICT MUN Club. We believe in unbiased and accurate reporting on
              crucial issues and important happenings around the world, our
              teams of writers and researchers work tirelessly, with meticulous
              care, to report factually accurate data and our graphic designers
              help in presenting the data in an interesting and informative
              method. We believe people can make an informed decision when they
              have the facts and truth about different important issues thus
              upholding democratic values. We believe that journalism plays an
              irreplaceable, important and powerful role in protecting values
              like liberty, equality and fraternity in the global world order.
              The team has also conducted two successful editions of the ‘Write
              For Us’ contest wherein we accept articles, photographs and
              illustrations from interested individuals and feature the winning
              entries in our newsletter.
