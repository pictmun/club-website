              The PICT MUN Club organizes an annual MUN conference with an
              ever-increasing turnout of enthusiastic and unique set of people
              including everyone from school children to undergraduates and
              postgraduates who gather together in order to discuss and debate
              on important issues in various committees with different agendas.
              The annual MUN conference is an interesting occasion for
              like-minded people to discuss and discover different views on
              global issues through the eyes of various countries. The annual
              MUN conference is one of the most prestigious conferences in the
              circuit and is the only event at PICT that hosts such a diverse
              crowd including international delegates as well as national
              delegates from various states of the country!
